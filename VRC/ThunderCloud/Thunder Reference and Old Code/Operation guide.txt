		For approximately 5 seconds after being powered on, the robot will initialize its gyroscope. DO NOT move the robot during this time.

Sensor inputs/outputs:
	LCD: Battery and status readout and [TODO]autonomous select
	Arm potentiometer: read actual arm heights for [TODO]presets and autonomous
	Right control potentiometer: fine control of arm position [TODO]during autonomous
	gyro: hold heading when no turn is being applied by the driver.
