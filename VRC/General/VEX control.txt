You can run 19 tasks + 1 main task simultaneously.
All tasks should have a wait1Msec(x) line based on how often the need to run (CORTEX data rates below,  15-50 is sufficient for user control), 
or else tasks will unnecessarily hog CPU time and may not execute properly.
Alternatively, to solve this problem and still allow the task to run as often as possible, use AbortTimeSlice().
A higher number is higher priority. Priority can be set when a task is started or later.

Motors 2-9 update about every 20msec
Motors 1,10 update every 1msec
Motor control tasks do not need to run any more frequently than this
